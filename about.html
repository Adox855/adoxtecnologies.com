    Innovation goals are the specific, measurable objectives an organization sets to drive progress and achieve its broader vision for innovation, often focusing on areas like developing new products, improving customer satisfaction, increasing efficiency, or achieving sustainability. Effective innovation goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) and provide a roadmap for innovation efforts, ensuring they align with the overall business strategy and lead to tangible results.
